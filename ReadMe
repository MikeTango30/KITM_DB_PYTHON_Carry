Carry task:
In elementary arithmetic, a carry is a digit that is transferred 
from one column of digits to another column
of more significant digits.

# Write a function that takes two integers (a and b) and outputs
how many times carry was used during sum of them, i.e.

 a = 99
 b = 9

 the output should be 2

Another example:
a = 190101
B = 909909

 The output should be 4
